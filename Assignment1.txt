Part 1: Read the data file

In Part 1 of the assignment I used two different data structures
ArrayLists and arrays.

The Arraylists were created to store the information from the csv file.
They were also used to isolate all the tags as well as store all of 
them sorted in Alphabetical order

The array was used to store the contents of the csv file. 
Which allowes me to access the values in each row of the csv file.
This was important to extract the tags from the entire contents of the file.

The algorithms used in Part 1 were insertion sort wnich was used twice.
Firstly to sort the csv file as it was read in. But also to sort the ArrayLists
in alphabetical order which was crucial for the assignment regarding Part 2.

The running time for part one mainly dependent on the algorithms used.
Being that insertion sort was used, which has a worst case running time of O(n^2)
Therefore Part 1 has a running time of O(n^2) (Exponential)

Part 2: List most and least popular tags

In Part 2 of the assignment, the data structures used were ArrayLists

The ArrayList was used to count all of the tags occurences. An ArrayList
where its elements index was matched to an ArrayList that was sorted in
alphabetical order. This was crucial for the assignment which resulted in
being able to find the three highest and three lowest occuring tags.
Because of the alphabetical order, finding the three highest was done by
iterating through the front of the ArrayList, while finding the three lowest was 
done by iterating from the back of the ArrayList.

When finding the three lowest and highest tags a linear search algotithm is used.
It is finding the indices of the lowest values in the ArrayList containg the count
of all the tags. Working from the front and back of the ArrayList.

The running time of this Part of the assignment is mainly dependent of
the function that counts all the occurences of the tags and stores them in an ArrayList.
The runningtime for that function is O(n^2) because of its nested for loop. Otherwise
the other functions that finds the three highest and lowest tags has a runningtime of O(n).
Therefore Part 2 has a running time of O(n^2) (Exponential)

Part 3: Find tags by count or tag counts by name or by counts.

In Part 3 of the assignment, the data structures used were ArrayLists and arrays.

Although the only one created in this part was an array which had the same function 
as the array in Part 1. The previous created Arraylists were used to find tags and 
their counts.

There are two sorts of seach algorithms used in Part 3. Both linear, but one to find tags
with a certain count. And another to find the number of occurences of a specific tag.

The running time in Part 3 is mainly dependent on the search algorithms.
Where the running time is O(n) where n is the size of the input data that
it searches over.
Therefore the runningtime is O(n) (linear)
